## Overview

* Impressive QSM model with an endogenous investment decision.
* Interesting historical setting: Helpful to think about path dependency of large infrastructure projects.
* Paper seems fairly matured by now, under revision at a prestigious journal...so, not many comments left to make?

. . .

👍

. . .

* Will try with a few clarifying questions.
* Some comments about computation.

## Questions

### What is `Reshaping`?

Some help with Table 1 please:

>This decomposition shows that the highway network in 1974 was considerably reshaped from what had been set out in the plan designed 40 years earlier.

* Talking only about West, right?
* Map (even only part) would be super helpful
* Appendix C was not enough. Are there more higways than in figure 1?

## Questions

### How does Path Dependence counterfactual work?

::: {style="font-size: 80%;"}
> I solve for the unconstrained infrastructure allocation in West Germany by assuming that no highway had been built before division

:::

* Why is assuming that no highway had been built in West Germany the right thing to do here?
* I understand the infrastructure part (compare _wrongly built_ network with optimal one).
* But are you not kind of ignoring the population distribution? Some cities may exist only _because_ they got the _wrong_ highways in the first place.
* I may not properly understand how the dynamics play out here. How does one transition from 1949 to 1974?



## Questions

### What is Investment into Highways actually?

Once a highway is built, the main cost has been incured? What *exactly* is highway investment?

::: {.incremental}
* Maintainance?
* Adding a lane?
* Renewing surface?
* Some background would be helpful. Like, how *important* is $\phi_{i,j}$ once the highway exists?

# Computation {background-color="#40666e"}


## Computation

### This is a hard problem

$$
\begin{align}
\max_{\phi_n} & \left[ \sum_n \left(\frac{v_n}{P_n^\alpha r_n^{1-\alpha}}\right)^\epsilon \right]^{1/\epsilon} \\
s.t. \quad & (10)-(13) \quad \text{(SE)}\\
           & (17) \quad \text{(TC)} \\
           & (18) \quad \text{(BC)}
\end{align}
$$

::: {.fragment}

simplified into 👉
$\max_{\phi_n} U^{eq} = f(w^{eq}(\phi),P^{eq}(\phi),r^{eq}(\phi),L^{eq}(\phi),T^{eq}(\phi),\phi)\quad (21)$

* (21) not clear. What is $f$? no constraints? $w^{eq}(\phi)$ fixed at step $k$?
* Seems a nested fixed point strategy.
:::

## Computation

### Suggestions (👋 hand-waving alert)

* _No Analytic Gradients_
* Use a language with good AD support. `julia + JuMP.jl + IPopt.jl`
* @judd-su
* [JuMP.jl](https://jump.dev/) @Lubin2023
* You would solve the full constrained problem on previous slide, no iteration. 
* I.e. you choose $\{\phi_n,w_n,P_n,r_n,L_n\}$ at the same time.
* You could combine steps 1 and 3 of your algorithm. Maybe even step 2 as well (not sure about complexity of this)


## Computation

### Suggestions 👋


```julia
# not tested. (of course.)
using JuMP, Ipopt
function MartaSteps1and3(T::Matrix)
    N = size(T,1)  # T is the current transport costs matrix
    m = Model(Ipopt.Optimizer)
    @variable(m, 1 <= ϕ[1:N])
    @variable(m, 0 <= w[1:N])
    . . . # define all choice variables
    @constraint(m, eq10[n=1:N], 
        sum( (L[i] / (σ*F) (σ/(σ-1)) w[i]/A[i] * T[n,i]) * P[i]^(σ-1) * w[i] * L[i]     
    for i in 1:N)
    . . . # define all constraints (10-13)
    @expression(m, v[i=1:N], . . . ) # define
    @objective(m, sum( (v[n] / (P[n]^α * r[n]^(1-α)))^ϵ for n in 1:N)^(1/ϵ))

    optimize!(m)  
    # build's AD gradient+hessian+sparsity structure
    # and hands over to Ipopt
end
```

# End 👋
