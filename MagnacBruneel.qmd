## Overview

* Paper in the best tradition of careful investigation of identification in complex structural models.
* Novel result on joint identification of exogenous moving shock and fixed costs of moving.
* Promising results from beginnings of structural estimation.

. . .

üëç

. . .

* Paper is still much work in progress.
* I will pose some clarifying questions, hopefully helpful.

## Overview

* Dynamic Housing Demand models are complex: mixed discrete (move/not) - continuous (size of house, assets, consumption) choices 
* Most papers rely on strict parameterization of moving costs.
* Proofs of identification is rare in this literature.
*

## Questions

### What is correct form of utility?

![](img/utility.png)

* Is this correct? how does this affect substitution between $c$ and $s$?

# @bajari

It seems you are following this paper closely, which is fine. I did look at their utility function to try and understand better.

## Questions

### What is the contribution of the paper?

* Very lengthy literature section which tries to cover a lot of different literatures. 
  
* Define the contribution early on. 

* The potential policy experimens remain somewhat vague. 


## Questions

### What is $\eta$ ?


üëâ Tell us early on. 

üëâ It's not clear _at all_ why we need $\epsilon$ _and_ $\eta$. 

üëâ The existence of the entire paper hinges on it, so tell us more about it.

### $s$ is not _Quality_

Two _identical_ flats.

## Main Comments

### $s$ is not _Quality_

* Quality might differ across $d$ [@halket2020housing]
* An owner of a 80 m2 flat who moves from Paris to an 80 m2 (owned) flat in Lyon is not moving in the model. Clearly moves in reality.
* The location (area, neighborhood) is potentially an important determinant of moving choices. Given $s$ is defined as _size_, this characteristic of the house i smissing. 
* Affects choices via shock $p^m$. Some discussion and expected size of biases should be added. What fraction of movers go to a different neighorhood/city/area and into same $s$?

### $s$ is not _Quality_

## Main Comments

### Proving Separate Identification of Objects

* Should probably be the focus of the paper.

# Computation {background-color="#40666e"}

## Computational Concerns?

* What are the computational implications of the method? We do not get many insights into computational performance. Usually, models of this kind face binding constraints in terms of computational feasibility.
* In that sense, how does this method compare to recent advances by @iskhakov2017endogenous @DRUEDAHL201787 or @oswald2019effect and similar efforts?
